Hello, I am Mushahid Intesum. I have completed my graduation from the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Dhaka, and am currently employed at Therap BD Ltd as a Software Engineer.

# Research Interests
I am deeply interested in **Efficient Deep Learning** with the goal of making training, inference and deployment of deep learning model efficient and increasing the capability of these models on resource constrained platforms. I think for deep learning to truly change the world for good, it has to be democratized and be approachable to everyone. In order to do that, it has to be made affordable and widely available through affordable and widely available means, such as mobile phones, wearables and possibly robotics. Also, training and fine-tuning of pre-trained models has to be made more cost effective for innovations to happen at grassroots level. Hence, I am keenly interested in making current really large deep learning methods more efficient, make training \& fine-tuning more cost effective \& feasible and develop easily available and affordable applications.

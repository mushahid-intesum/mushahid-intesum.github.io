Education
======
* BSc at University of Dhaka, 2024
* SSC at Notre Dame College, 2018
* SSC at Dhaka Residential Model College, 2016

Publications
======
  * Mushahid Intesum, Abdullah Ibne Masud, Md Rezaul Karim, and Md Ashraful Islam (n.d.). “STFT-GradTTS: A Robust, Diffusion-based Speech Synthesis System with iSTFT decoder for Bangla, Under Review”. In: Under Review ()

Projects
======
* Speech Synthesizer for Bangla
  * Funded by the University Grants Commission, we are working on building a novel Speech Synthesizer made specifically for Bangla. Our project aims to tackle the data scarcity problem of Bangla by preparing a large, 20-hour-long, single-speaker audio dataset that is collected in a studio quality environment. We also proposed STFT-GradTTS, a novel diffusion based TTS model with multi-stream iSTFT decoders and Stochastic Duration Predictor. The paper is under review
* Llava Efficiency Experiments
  * An independent research project where I attemtpted to investigate post-training pruning of attention tokens in the vision-tower and cross-modal fusion towers of Llava 7B model to find possible opportunities for post training optimization. The code was tested on 2x T4 GPU option of Kaggle.
* Bird Call Identifier Using ESP32
  * A bird call identifier deployed on ESP32 MCU with on-device inference. Using the BirdClef dataset, the model was trained, quantized and deployed on the ESP32. Utilized hierarchical labels and class balanced sampling

Talks & Workshops

Work experience
======
* March 2024 - Present: Therap BD Ltd
  * Software Engineer
  * Working as a Software Engineer at Therap(BD) Ltd. I work on a scalable, large scale application based on Spring, Oracle and Hibernate that serves thousands on clients.

* April 2023 - May 2024: University of Dhaka
  * Research Assistant
  * Worked as a research assistant where we worked to create a Speech Synthesizer for Bangla from scratch. The project aims to address data scarcity in Bangla by collecting a large single-speaker audio dataset that spans more than 20 hours and a novel TTS system made for Bangla.

* June 2023 - January 2024: One Data Labs
  * Data Engineer
  * Worked as a Data Engineer at One Data Labs which is based in Serbia. Key tasks included scraping raw data from sources, creating a pipeline for data collection, cleaning data and analysing the data to find interesting insights for product development
